# Workshop 02 Rubric

Below is the rubric for Workshop 02: Git Introduction. This workshop is out of a total of 16 points.

As part of the peer review process you will be evaluating 3 submissions from other students. You will need to use the GitHub interface to look at the changes made to the submitted repository. You will need to review the commits, the changes made by those commits, and determine if the submission satisfied each of the criteria below.

**Criteria 1 - Step 03 and 04**: `commit`ted an edit to `README.md`, and `push`ed it to GitHub.

* 0 points: the commit is missing
* 1 point: the commit exists, but an edit to the `README.md` file is not present.
* 2 points: the commit exists and an edit to the `README.md` file exists.

**Criteria 2 - Step 05**: `add`ed `data.txt` to the repository.

* 0 points: the commit does not exist.
* 1 point: the commit exists, but `data.txt` was not added.
* 2 points: the commit exists and `data.txt` was added.

**Criteria 3 - Step 06**: `mv`ed `data.txt` to `data.dat`

* 0 points: the commit is missing.
* 1 point: the commit exists, but `data.txt` has not been moved to `data.dat`.
* 2 points: the commit exists and `data.txt` has been moved to `data.dat`.

**Criteria 4 - Step 07**: valid screenshot of `git pull` output (added/committed/pushed in Step 12)

* 0 points: the commit is missing.
* 1 point: the commit exists, but the screenshot does not exists.
* 2 points: the commit exists and the screenshot exists.

**Criteria 5 - Step 08**: caused (and handled) a merge conflict.

* 0 points: the commit is missing.
* 1 point: the commit exists, but it is not clear if a merge conflict was resolved (no mention in commit message).

**Criteria 6 - Step 09**: valid screenshot of destructed repository (added/committed/pushed in Step 12).

* 0 points: the commit is missing.
* 1 point: the commit exists, but the screenshot doesn't exist.
* 2 points: the commit exists and the screenshot exists.

**Criteria 7 - Step 10**: removed `password.txt` from the repository using a `rebase`.

* 0 points: the commit is missing.
* 1 point: the commit exists, but `password.txt` still exists.
* 2 points: the commit exists and `password.txt` does not exist.

**Criteria 8 - Step 11**: `revert`ed a mistake.
